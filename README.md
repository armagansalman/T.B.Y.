# T.B.Y. (Tasarlanmış Bilge Yardımcı) (Designed Wise Helper)
T.B.Y. is a wise helper. It is a humanoid system with wisdom, intelligence and means of perception.
<br>By definition, it is innately benevolent. By definition, it can not be coerced. It protects itself.

Being a helper, it makes our lives easier.
<br>Being wise, it is benevolent and always offers the best choice, takes the best action.
<br>Designed in such a way that its properties of being wise and being a helper can not be altered.
<br>Just like removing a syntactic character from a program's text, if T.B.Y. is altered in any way, it stops completely.


## Why Not A.G.I. ?
A.G.I. (Artificial General Intelligence) focuses on the wrong goal. Intelligence without wisdom can and most likely cause damage.
<br>You can verify this fact by looking at how intelligent but unwise people harm others.
<br>This is why intelligence must be guided by wisdom to make wise decisions that won't harm people or other beings.

Thus, what we want is WISE systems with general intelligence which will help humanity.
